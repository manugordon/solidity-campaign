# CrowdCoin

### CrowdCoin is a platform where users can contribute to campaigns for products that need funding, with the funds being denominated in ether. Each campaign is managed by its manager and what sets it apart is that when the manager wants to withdraw funds for project improvements, they must send a request that needs to be approved by all the contributors of the campaign. This ensures that everything is recorded and is 100% secure for the contributors.

### The logic of the campaign is implemented as a smart contract written in Solidity, while the frontend of the application was built using React and NextJS.

## How it works
### Users can create campaigns and become managers of them.
### Managers can create spending requests for the campaign.
### Contributors can approve the spending requests.
### Once a request is approved by the majority of the contributors, the manager can finalize the request and receive the funds.

## Technology Stack
### Solidity
### React
### Next.JS

## Getting Started
### Install dependencies using npm install.
### Start the application using npm run dev.
### Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in the browser.
